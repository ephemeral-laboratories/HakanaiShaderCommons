Unreleased

* Added editor scripts to create raycast or raymarch shaders from
  their respective templates.

v0.2.0

* Made `pModPolar` work like it should.
  It was returning the new position, but should have mutated the
  position and returned the cell, for consistency with other similar
  functions.
* Renamed color conversion functions to a consistent style.

v0.1.0

* Added the ability to be referenced as a Unity Package.
